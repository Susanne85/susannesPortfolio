**Susanne's Portfolio**

This project is my latest portfolio page.  It displays three applications that I have written and one project with other
team members that I have worked on.
Each of the applications have increased in complexity and technologies utilised.  

Whenever any of the links are clicked then a new page is presented to the user.

The text instructing the user what to do to change the colour of the picture will change depending on the device.

The hamburger menu on mobile devices operates with the same options as the menu in tablet mode. 

**Link**

The link to the deployed application is : https://susanne85.github.io/susannesPortfolio/

**Technologies Utilised**
